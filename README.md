# ost-pv-web

This repository contains the web portion of the University of Michigan OCM OST-PV Data Acquisition Module. It was built by Joseph Maffetone, Evan Travis, Adarsh Ponaka, Sammy Saad, and Joshua Siegel for their EECS 473 MDE Project in Fall 2023. The website assumes the existence of a embedded system attached to the OST-PV solar modules, which was also built by the team.

Please navigate to the `backend` or `frontend` folders to view more information about their respective parts, include Quick Starts.
