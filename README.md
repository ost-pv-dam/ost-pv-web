Web app portion of the University of Michigan OCM ST-OPV Data Acquisition Module

Note: Most of the development for the project assumed the name of the solar cells to be "Organic Semi-Transparent Photovoltaics (OST-PVs)" but we were notified later that the researchers were calling them "Semi-Transparent Organic Photovoltaics (ST-OPVs)." The easy name changes have been made (such as the title of the website), but there was not enough time to make the more complex ones (domain name, database name, AWS infrastructure). As such, you will find artifacts of the old naming mechanism in the codebase.

## About

This project was built by Joseph Maffetone, Evan Travis, Adarsh Ponaka, Sammy Saad, and Joshua Siegel for their EECS 473 MDE Project in Fall 2023. The website assumes the existence of a embedded system attached to the ST-OPV solar modules, which was also built by the team.
